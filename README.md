# Nates Facebook Suppressor Chrome Plugin
### Created 3/29/2017

The "Trending", "Shows From Facebook Watch", and "Sponsored" sections on the sidebar of the Facebook wall irritate me, so I lazily threw this quick Chrome plugin together to remove them.

I do not plan on maintaining this.

## Installation:
1. Click the green *Clone or Download* button towards the top of this page.
2. Click the *Download ZIP* option
3. Unzip the file and put it somewhere where you won't delete it on your computer
4. Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
5. In the top right corner, there's a switch for `Developer mode`. Activate that switch.
6. Drag and Drop that unzipped folder onto the screen.
7. You'll see the "Nates Facebook Suppressor" plugin. Activate it.

You're done!
